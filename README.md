# MagicMirror-Hackathon

Hackathon for the [MagicMirrorÂ² project](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror) and [3rd party modules](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/wiki/3rd-party-modules). Forum post https://forum.magicmirror.builders/topic/9298/magicmirror-hackathon-2018.

## What is a hackathon?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon

## Why?

I contributed and created a lot of 3rd party modules during my studies. Since I have a job I barely find time to maintain just one of them. So I want to spend 48h to get them back to live.

## When?

It's happening from 2018-12-26 08:00 until 2018-12-28 08:00 [UTC time zone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone/utc).

## How can I contribute?

### Be a Product Owner

Add your ideas for the hackathon and create issues in this project. They can be new features, bug fixes or improvements to the core project or any third party module (don't forget to link the repository). Make sure you give detailed descriptions etc. Also note if there is a specific hardware required, as not everyone has this hardware and it is not easy to develop without actually being able to test it properly. The same rule applies if there is an api key required, because some providers go through a manual review which is most likely stopped during the holidays.

### Be a Developer

If you want to contribute, then pick an idea of the [project board](https://github.com/fewieden/MagicMirror-Hackathon/projects/1), leave a comment on the issue that you started working on it. As soon as you finish create a pull request to the project.

### Be a Quality Assurance

If you want to contribute, then pick an issue in the review state of the [project board](https://github.com/fewieden/MagicMirror-Hackathon/projects/1), test the changes and leave comments with what needs to be changed or if is not working. If everything is fine give your thumbs up.

## How can I follow the process?

First I wanted to stream, so people can watch me coding. But my internet is too weak, in order to provide a decent quality :(
But I'm trying to update the [project board](https://github.com/fewieden/MagicMirror-Hackathon/projects/1) as often as reasonable. I will also be available through [discord](https://discord.gg/4gQHqGx), where I want to give updates or talk to people or answer coding related questions.
